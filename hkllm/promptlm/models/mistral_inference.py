SITMH
Suicide is a result of poor mental health.
Anxiety, depression, dementia, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, bipolar (or bi-polar)
disorder, autism, ADHD, and mania are all types of mental health issues. Possible symptoms of
mental health issues include acting weird or crazy or strange, hallucinations, belief in conspiracy
theories, suicidal thoughts, and erratic behavior.
Anxiety refers to anticipation of a future concern and is more associated with muscle tension
and avoidance behavior. Generalized anxiety disorder involves persistent and excessive worry
that interferes with daily activities. This ongoing worry and tension may be accompanied by
physical symptoms, such as restlessness, feeling on edge or easily fatigued, difficulty
concentrating, muscle tension or problems sleeping.
Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest.
Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and
behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble
doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn't worth living.
Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning — thinking, remembering, and reasoning — to
such an extent that it interferes with a person's daily life and activities. Some people with
dementia cannot control their emotions, and their personalities may change. Dementia ranges in
severity from the mildest stage, when it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning, to the
most severe stage, when the person must depend completely on others for basic activities of
daily living, such as feeding oneself.
Psychotic symptoms include changes in the way a person thinks, acts, and experiences the
world. People with psychotic symptoms may lose a shared sense of reality with others and
experience the world in a distorted way. For some people, these symptoms come and go. For
others, the symptoms become stable over time.

Hallucinations: When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not actually
there. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may
hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.
Delusions: When a person has strong beliefs that are not true and may seem irrational to
others. For example, individuals experiencing delusions may believe that people on the radio
and television are sending special messages that require a certain response, or they may
believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.
Thought disorder: When a person has ways of thinking that are unusual or illogical. People with
thought disorder may have trouble organizing their thoughts and speech. Sometimes a person
will stop talking in the middle of a thought, jump from topic to topic, or make up words that have
no meaning.
Movement disorder: When a person exhibits abnormal body movements. People with
movement disorder may repeat certain motions over and over.
Alzheimer’s disease is a brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and,
eventually, the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. In most people with the disease — those
with the late-onset type symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s occurs
between a person’s 30s and mid-60s and is very rare. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common
cause of dementia among older adults.
Bipolar I disorder is defined by manic episodes that last for at least 7 days (nearly every day for
most of the day) or by manic symptoms that are so severe that the person needs immediate
medical care. Usually, depressive episodes occur as well, typically lasting at least 2 weeks.
Episodes of depression with mixed features (having depressive symptoms and manic symptoms
at the same time) are also possible. Experiencing four or more episodes of mania or depression
within 1 year is called “rapid cycling.”
Bipolar II disorder is defined by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes. The
hypomanic episodes are less severe than the manic episodes in bipolar I disorder.
Cyclothymic disorder (also called cyclothymia) is defined by recurring hypomanic and
depressive symptoms that are not intense enough or do not last long enough to qualify as
hypomanic or depressive episodes.
Mania is a condition in which you have a period of abnormally elevated, extreme changes in
your mood or emotions, energy level or activity level. This highly energized level of physical and
mental activity and behavior must be a change from your usual self and be noticeable by others.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how
people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be
diagnosed at any age, it is described as a “developmental disorder” because symptoms
generally appear in the first 2 years of life. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a guide created by the American Psychiatric Association that health
care providers use to diagnose mental disorders, people with ASD often have difficulty with
communication and interaction with other people, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors,
symptoms that affect their ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common mental disorders
affecting children. Symptoms of ADHD include inattention (not being able to keep focus),
hyperactivity (excess movement that is not fitting to the setting) and impulsivity (hasty acts that
occur in the moment without thought). ADHD is considered a chronic and debilitating disorder
and is known to impact the individual in many aspects of their life including academic and
professional achievements, interpersonal relationships, and daily functioning (Harpin, 2005).
ADHD can lead to poor self-esteem and social function in children when not appropriately
treated (Harpin et al., 2016). Adults with ADHD may experience poor self-worth, sensitivity
towards criticism, and increased self-criticism possibly stemming from higher levels of criticism
throughout life (Beaton, et al., 2022).
SIT
Situations are common in police reports. It means that something of importance has happened.
This can include victims or perpetrators becoming angry, violent, upset, or drunk. Situations may
include gun violence, abuse, aggression, crying, arguing, domestic violence, being arrested,
and yelling.
Domestic violence, social and legal concept that, in the broadest sense, refers to any
abuse—including physical, emotional, sexual, or financial—between intimate partners, often
living in the same household. The term is often used specifically to designate physical assaults
upon women by their male partners, but, though rarer, the victim may be a male abused by his
female partner, and the term may also be used regarding abuse of both women and men by
same-sex partners.
Gun-related violence is violence committed with the use of a firearm. Gun-related violence may
or may not be considered criminal. Criminal violence includes homicide (except when and
where ruled justifiable), assault with a deadly weapon, and suicide, or attempted suicide,
depending on jurisdiction. Non-criminal violence includes accidental or unintentional injury and
death (except perhaps in cases of criminal negligence).
To abuse is to treat someone cruelly or violently. The most common forms are domestic abuse,
child abuse, and animal abuse. It occurs most commonly to people or animals who are unable
to defend themselves.
When a person is drunk or intoxicated, they have had too much alcohol and may act disorderly.
This can include slurred speech, problems walking, and vision problems.
A person who is drunk or who has taken drugs can be referred to as “under the influence.”
Social psychologists define aggression as behavior that is intended to harm another individual
who does not wish to be harmed (Baron & Richardson, 1994). Because it involves the
perception of intent, what looks like aggression from one point of view may not look that way
from another, and the same harmful behavior may or may not be aggressive depending on its
intent.
Social psychologists use the term violence to refer to aggression that has extreme physical
harm, such as injury or death, as its goal. Thus violence is a subset of aggression. All violent
acts are aggressive, but only acts that are intended to cause extreme physical damage, such as
murder, assault, rape, and robbery, are violent. Slapping someone really hard across the face
might be violent, but calling people names would only be aggressive.
Physical aggression is aggression that involves harming others physically—for instance hitting,
kicking, stabbing, or shooting them. Nonphysical aggression is aggression that does not involve
physical harm. Nonphysical aggression includes verbal aggression (yelling, screaming,
swearing, and name calling) and relational or social aggression, which is defined as intentionally
harming another person’s social relationships, for instance by gossiping about another person,
excluding others from our friendship, or giving others the “silent treatment” (Crick & Grotpeter,
1995). Nonverbal aggression also occurs in the form of sexual, racial, and homophobic jokes
and epithets, which are designed to cause harm to individuals.
Some situations require governmental departments to intervene. The Georgia Bureau of
Investigation (GBI), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) may be part of the solution. Other solutions include temporary protective
orders (TPO), a restraining order, or arrest.
Abduction and running away are various reasons for a person to go missing. Children and the
elderly are often the victims in these situations.
CHI
A child, also known as a kid, toddler, baby, infant, youth, teen, or adolescent, may be present at
the time a police officer arrives. Children are often vulnerable, so they may be victims.
CRI
Assault is generally defined as an intentional act that puts another person in reasonable
apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. No physical injury is required, but the
actor must have intended to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the victim and the victim
must have thereby been put in immediate apprehension of such a contact. Assault is a crime.
A harmful contact of battery is contact causing physical impairment or injury, while an offensive
contact of battery is a contact that makes a reasonable person of ordinary sensibilities feel
threatened. Battery is a crime.
Assault refers to the wrong act of causing someone to reasonably fear imminent harm. This
means that the fear must be something a reasonable person would foresee as threatening to
them. Battery refers to the actual wrong act of physically harming someone.
Crime, the intentional commission of an act usually deemed socially harmful or dangerous and
specifically defined, prohibited, and punishable under criminal law. A criminal is a person who
commits a crime. An act that is illegal is a crime.
Homicide is the killing of one human being by another. Homicide is a general term and may
refer to either a noncriminal act or the criminal act of murder. Some homicides are considered
justifiable, while others are said to be excusable. Criminal homicide is not regarded by the
applicable criminal code as justifiable or excusable.
Driving under the influence (DUI), also known as “drinking and driving,” is a crime. Drunk driving
is often caught because the driver swerves the car, drives too fast, or ignores driving laws.
To kidnap is to seize and detain or carry away by unlawful force or fraud and often with a
demand for ransom. This happens most often to women and children. Kidnapping is a crime.
Forced entry, illegal entry trespassing, or breaking-and-entering are all ways that a criminal may
enter a house or business.
Forcible entry means to enter a person’s property by force and against the occupants wishes. It
usually involves taking possession of a house, other structure, or land by using physical force or
serious threats against the occupants. This can include breaking open windows, doors, or other
parts of a house; or using terror to gain entry; or forcing the occupants out by threat or violence
after having entered peacefully.
Molestation is the crime of engaging in sexual acts with minors, including touching of private
parts, exposure of genitalia, taking of pornographic pictures, rape, inducement of sexual acts
with the molester or with other children, and variations of these acts. Molestation also applies to
incest by a relative with a minor family member and additionally any sexual acts short of rape.
Rape is a crime at common law defined as unlawful sexual intercourse with someone without
their consent and by means of fear, force, or coercion.
Robbery, shoplifting, and theft are all crimes and types of stealing. Robbery is the unlawful
taking of property from the person of another through the use of threat or force. Shoplifting is
generally defined as the unauthorized removal of merchandise from a store without paying for it,
or intentionally paying less for an item than its sale price. However, shoplifting can include
carrying, hiding, concealing, or otherwise manipulating merchandise with the intent of taking it or
paying less for it.
Theft is the taking of another person’s personal property with the intent of depriving that person
of the use of their property. Also referred to as larceny. Theft is often divided into grand theft and
petty theft. If the value of the stolen goods is over a certain amount determined by the state’s
statute, then the crime may be elevated to grand theft. The type of goods stolen may impact
whether the theft is grand or petty as well.
Trafficking is the transporting of or transacting in illegal goods or people.
Drug trafficking is the illegal transporting of or transacting in controlled substances. Under
federal law, Title 21, Section 841 makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally
“manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or
dispense, a controlled substance.”
Human trafficking, also known as trafficking in persons, is a crime that involves compelling or
coercing a person to provide labor or services, or to engage in commercial sex acts. The
coercion can be subtle or overt, physical or psychological. Exploitation of a minor for
commercial sex is human trafficking, regardless of whether any form of force, fraud, or coercion
was used.
Vandalism is the willful or malicious destruction or defacement of public or private property.
Vandals often use spray paint to deface property with graffiti.
Graffiti is a form of visual communication, usually illegal, involving the unauthorized marking of
public space by an individual or group. Although the common image of graffiti is a stylistic
symbol or phrase spray-painted on a wall by a member of a street gang, some graffiti is not
gang-related. Graffiti can be understood as antisocial behaviour performed in order to gain
attention or as a form of thrill seeking, but it also can be understood as an expressive art form.
Arson is a crime at common law, originally defined as “the malicious burning of the dwelling of
another.”
Intimidation is an act or course of conduct directed at a specific person to cause that person to
fear or apprehend fear. Usually, an individual intimidates others by deterring or coercing them to
take an action they do not want to take. Intimidation can be a crime.
DRU
Drugs refer to any substance that is illegal to use and/or use in excess. Some examples of
illegal drugs are alcohol, cocaine, acid, cannabis (also known as “weed” or “marijuana”),
diazepam, ecstasy, hallucinogens, heroin, ketamine, kratom, LSD, MDMA, meth (also known as
methamphetamines), amphetamines, molly, mushrooms, narcotics, beer, opiates, PCP, peyote,
salvia, vodka, and wine.
Violation of Georgia Controlled Substances Act (VGCSA) is a crime that refers to possession of
marijuana, cocaine, or methamphetamine in Georgia.
Possession, distribution, or use of drugs can be a crime. Some synonyms of “drug” are “dope”
and “substance”.
Contraband refers to items that are illegal to trade, carry, produce, or otherwise have in one's
possession. Contraband may be goods that are illegal to import or export and are attempted to
be smuggled into a country, or items that are banned from a facility. Drugs are a common
contraband.
Drugs can be in the form of a pill, a powder, or an inhalant. Drugs may need a tool such as a
syringe, a cutting agent, or a grinder.
Alcohol is illegal to use in excess in public. Beer, wine, vodka, whiskey, tequila, rum, and liquor
are all types of alcohol
